    \subsection{Embedding of $\calm_{0,n}$ into the torus $T^{\binom{n}{2} - 2}$}
    \label{subsec:embedding-m-0n-into-torus}
        We start from recalling the Grassmannians in Section \ref{sec:tropical-grassmannians}.
        In the work of \citet{Maclagan2010}, we obtain the following geometric quotient:
        Let $\gr^0(2, n)$ be the open contained in $\gr(2, n)$.
        It is the set of subspaces of dimension $2$ that are mapped to nonvanishing Pl\"{u}cker coordinates,
        under the Pl\"{u}cker map.
        Geometrically, these are the two-planes that do not pass through the intersection of any pair of coordinate hyperplanes,
        which implies that the torus $T^{n-1}$ 
        acts freely on $\gr^0(2, n)$ 
        (i.e. the stabilizer of the action is trivial)
        and all the orbits are maximal dimensional.
        Let $\overline{\calm}_{0, n}$ 
        be the moduli space of smooth $n$-pointed rational curves.
        The moduli space $\calm_{0, n}$ 
        is thus equal to the geometric quotient     of $\gr^0(2, n)/ T^{n-1}$.
        By Theorem 4.1.8 in \citet{Kapranov1993}, the compactification of $\calm_{0, n}$ is thus the Chow quotient of $\gr(2, n)$.
        That is 
        \[
        \gr(2, n) /^\text{Ch}T^{n-1} = \overline{\calm}_{0, n}. 
        \]
    
        Recall that in Subsection \ref{subsec:grassmannians-as-projective-varieties} and Example \ref{ex:gr-2n-plucker-ideal}
        we worked out the fact that 
        the Grassmannian $\gr(2, n)$ is a     subvariety of $\P^{\binom{n}{2} - 1}$ 
        via the Pl\"{u}cker embedding.
        At the same time, 
        this embedding maps the $\gr(2, n)$ 
        to the torus of $\P^{\binom{n}{2} - 1}$.
        Therefore, we have 
        \[
        p(\calm_{0, m}) \subset (T^{\binom{n}{2} / T})/T^{n-1} \cong T^{\binom{n}{2} - n}.
        \]

    \subsection{Compactification of $\calm_{0, n}$}
    \label{subsec:compactification-m-0n}
        In light of Theorem 2.26 and 
        Example 2.18 of \citet{Cavalieri2014},
        we see the tropical moduli space $\calm_{0, n}^{\trop}$ 
        comes with an natural fan structure, namely the Bergman fan and an embedding in a vector space.
        
        Keeping the discussion of geometric tropicalization above and in Section \ref{sec:geometric-tropicalization} in mind,
        we state the following theorem.
        \begin{theorem}[Theorem 3.1, \citet{Cavalieri2014}]
            Consider the embedding of $\calm_{0, n}$ into the torus $T^{\binom{n}{2} - n}$ described above,
            The closure of $\calm_{0, n}$ in the toric variety $X(\calm_{0, n}^{\trop})$ is the compactification $\overline{\calm}_{0, n}$.
            Futhermore, the tropicalization of $\calm_{0, n}$ in this torus is $\calm_{0, n}^{\trop}$.
        \end{theorem}
