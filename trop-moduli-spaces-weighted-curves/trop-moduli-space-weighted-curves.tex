    We start with introducing basic concepts of moduli space.
    Hassett spaces are moduli spaces with weighted stable curves, 
    denoted as $\overline{\calm}_{g, w}$ for a particular genus $g$ and weight vector $w$.
    Then we base the work of \citet{Cavalieri2014}, 
    that showed that compactification and the fact 
    that it is a compactification of the hyperplane arrangements hold on these heavy/light Hassett spaces. 
    Then we want to find the tropicalization of the heavy/ligth Hassett spaces $\overline{\calm}_{0, w}$, 
    a polyhedral complex parametrizing leaf-labeled metric trees that can be thought of as Bergman fan, 
    which furthermore creates a toric variety $X_{\Sigma}$. 
    The work \citet{Cavalieri2014} showed that in the case when the weight vector $w$ is heavy/light, 
    the fan structure is isomorphic to $\calm_{0, w}^{\trop}$.
    However if the weights are not just heavy and light weights,
    we can still map $\overline{\calm}_{0, w}$ to the toric variety,
    by defining a natural projection $\pr_w$ associated with $w$,
    contracting some boundary strata.
    We will show that we can effectivize Theorem 6.7.14 in \cite{Maclagan2015}, 
    which states that there exists an isomorphism between the cohomology ring of the compactification of $\overline{\calm}_{0, w}$ 
    and the cohomology ring of the toric variety $X_\Sigma$.
    Hence, we could find the cohomology ring of $\overline{\calm}_{0, w}$
    by finding the the chow ring of $X_\Sigma$ which is can be calculated using the Bergman fan, 
    thereby giving a presentation of the intersection theory of these Hassett spaces.
    In this manuscript, 
    we follow the treatment of \citet{Cavalieri2014}
    and Chapter 6 of \citet{Maclagan2015}.
