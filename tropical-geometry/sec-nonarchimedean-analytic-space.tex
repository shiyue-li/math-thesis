\section{Nonarchimedean Analytic Space}
\label{sec:nonarchimedean-analytic-space}
    The recent work of \citet{Baker2015} has developed a number of general techniques for comparing finer properties of analytificaitons 
    and tropicalizations of algebraic varieties 
    and explore in depth the connection between 
    the natrual metrics on analytifications 
    and tropicalizations of curves 
    via Berkovich's theory 
    and the Bosch-Lu\"{u}tkebohmert-Raynaud theory of admissible 
    formal schemes. 
    We introduce Berkovich's theory of nonarchimedean analytic spaces.
    
    Let $K$ be an algebraically closed field
    that is complete with respect to a nontrivial nonarchimedean 
    valuation $\val: K \R \cup \{\infty\}$.
