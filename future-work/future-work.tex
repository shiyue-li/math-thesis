\chapter{Future Work}
In this thesis, we survey the theory and methods of computing of cohomology ring of Hassett spaces using techniques of geometric tropicalization, theory of matroids and toric varieties. We gave combinatorial description of the tropicalization of Hassett spaces with weighted vectors that only have $2$ heavy weights (Losev-Manin space) and investigated in depth the calculation of the cohomology of the space.  

For ongoing and future work, we are generalizing the computation of the Chow ring to Hassett spaces with weight vectors that contain more than $2$ heavy weights. 
Increasing the number of heavy weights enlarges drastically the space of phylogenetic trees that parametrizes the combinatorial types, which describes more details and yields delicate combinatorial structures. 
Along this line, we are working on weight vector that contains only $3$ weight vectors and giving detailed combinatorial description of the Bergman.
